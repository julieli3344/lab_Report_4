# Lab Report 4
In this lab, it will show through how to reproduce each of the steps from lab, 
## 1 : Log into ieng6
## 2 : Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
## 3 : Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
## 4 : Edit the code file ListExamples.java to fix the failing test (as a reminder, the error in the code is just that index1 is used instead of index2 in the final loop in merge)
## 5 : Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
## 6 : Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
